Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering**

1.	Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
ANSWER: Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. It involves software product design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
		The importance in the technology industry.
	It enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, agriculture, education and healthcare.
2.	Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
ANSWER: The emergence of advancement in technology has triggered the rapid growth of software engineering program and involvement of software engineers over how people activities could be aided for better living over the years. Here are some key points:
a.	Emergence as a profession
b.	Methodologies and Processes: The introduction of structured methodologies transformed software development. 
c.	Role of women in early software engineering history featured influential women
Software engineering has come up from an art to a recognized engineering discipline with formal method, best practices and tool supporting the growth. As hardware cost decreased, software engineering practices adapted to leverage more powerful computing resources.

3.	List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
ANSWER:  
a.	Planning and Analysis: It’s all about understanding what to build and why. It cut across gathering business requirements from stakeholders, evaluate feasibility, revenue potential, costs, and user needs.
b.	Requirements definition: Convert information from planning phase to clear requirement for the development team.
c.	Design: Create architectural and detailed designs. Decide on the system’s structure, component and interface.
d.	Development: Developers write code, implement features, modules and functionality according to the requirements.
e.	Testing: Rigorous test of the software to identify defects, validate functionality and ensure quality.
f.	Deployment: Deploy the software to production environment. It involves installation, configuration and making it accessible to users.
g.	Maintenance: Maintenance of the software after deployment by fixing the defects, enhancing feature and addressing user feedback. Regular update and improvement fall into this phase.

 
4.	Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
ANSWER: 
WATERFALL	AGILE
1.	It follows a sequential path from beginning to the end, it involves distinct phases	Focuses on rapid iteration and flexibility. Work is divided into time-based sprints.
2.	Each stage has well-defined requirements, and work moves from one phase to the next	Agile teams are autonomous and self-organizing

5.	Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer:
a.	Discuss business requirement
b.	Code development
c.	Testing and debugging
d.	Collaboration
e.	Deployment
Quantity Assurance engineer:
a.	Test strategies
b.	Testing execution
c.	Troubleshooting
d.	Communication
e.	Monitoring and vulnerability detection
Project Manager:
a.	Requirement management
b.	Coordination and communication
c.	Resource allocation
d.	Methodology selection

6.	Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
ANSWER: 
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
a.	Efficient coding
b.	Syntax highlight
c.	Code completion
d.	Debugging
e.	Version control integration
Example: Visual studio provides powerful features for various languages and platforms

Version Control Systems (VCS)
a.	Change tracking
b.	Conflict prevention
c.	Recovery and history
d.	Traceability
Example: Git, a distributed VCS, revolutionized collaborative development by allowing teams to work remotely and manage code efficiently.

7.	What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
ANSWER: 
a.	Lack of workflow visibility
b.	Requirement volatility
c.	Limited budget resources
d.	Lack of communication and collaboration
e.	Security challenges
f.	Managing project deadline
SOLUTIONS
a.	Invest in tools like project management software, engineering analytics, and observability tools
b.	Finalize project requirements early, provide ample development time and involve stakeholders to reduce volatility
c.	Ensure realistic estimates, allocate suitable resources and communicate effectively with stakeholders.
d.	Foster collaboration, use tools like slack and encourage open communication between team members.
e.	Implement secure coding practices.
f.	Break down tasks, prioritize and use project management tools to track progress.

8.	Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing:
•	What: Unit testing verifies individual components (such as functions, classes, or modules) in isolation.
•	Importance:
a.	Early bug detection: Identifies issues before integration.
b.	Cleaner codebases: Acts as documentation and prevents “dinosaur code.”
Integration Testing:
•	What: Tests how related modules interact within a system.
•	Importance:
a.	Seamless integration: Ensures components work together.
b.	Identifies compatibility issues.
System Testing:
•	What: Evaluates the entire integrated software system.
•	Importance:
a.	Validates compliance with requirements.
b.	Detects flaws before release.
Acceptance Testing:
•	What: Ensures the software meets end-user requirements.
•	Importance:
a.	Validates overall functionality.
b.	Provides user perspective.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
1.	Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting your questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from your robot or AI assistant.
IMPORTANTS
a.	Precise communication
b.	Fine tuning AI. It guides models toward specific outputs, ensuring meaningful and coherent response.
c.	Streamlining development. It prompt engineers save time and resources by reducing trial and error during model training.

2.	Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.
1. Vague prompt:
a.	Original: Talk about programming
b.	Improved: Explain the key concepts of object-oriented programming.
2. Clear, Specific and concise prompt:
a. Original. How to code
b. Improved. Provide a python example of a function that calculates the factorial of a given positive integer.
 
3.	Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
a.	Specificity: The improved prompt clearly specifies the desired outcome—a Python function for factorial calculation. This precision guides the AI model toward relevant information.
b.	Context: The improved prompt clearly specifies the desired outcome—a Python function for factorial calculation. This precision guides the AI model toward relevant information.
c.	Conciseness: The improved prompt is concise, avoiding unnecessary details while conveying the essential requirement.
